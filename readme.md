<img src="./frontend/images_videos/logo_readme.png" alt="Construct Logo" width="200" height="200" />

## Overview
Construct is an AI-powered platform designed to assess the condition of infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings. Developed by **Team PrimAI**, the system analyzes images and user-provided data to generate detailed condition assessments. The goal is to enhance safety, optimize maintenance schedules, and prevent accidents.

## Features
- **Accurate AI Model**: Provides precise condition assessments and predictions.
- **Automated Image Analysis**: Uses AI to assess infrastructure conditions from images.
- **Bridge Condition Assessment**: Allows users to input specific details about bridges to receive an accurate structural assessment.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Forecasts maintenance needs and lifespan of roads, bridges, and buildings.
- **Web-Based Interface**: User-friendly dashboard for viewing AI-generated reports.
- **Modern UI & User-Friendly Design**: Ensures a seamless experience for users.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: SCSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python Flask
- **AI/ML Model**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Roboflow
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohan-droid7341/Structural-Health-Monitoring-System-Crack-detection-System
   cd Structural-Health-Monitoring-System-Crack-detection-System
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For backend (Python-based)
   npm install  # For frontend (if using React/Next.js)
   ```
3. **Run the Backend:**
   ```bash
   python app.py  # or your backend start command
   ```
4. **Access the Web App:**
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser.

## Usage
1. **Upload an Image**: Provide an image of infrastructure (road, bridge, or building).
2. **AI Analysis**:
   - For roads and buildings, the AI model analyzes the image and provides a condition assessment.
   - For bridges, enter specific details about the structure to receive an assessment.
3. **View Results**: Access the condition assessment on the dashboard.
